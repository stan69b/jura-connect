# Jura WiFi protocol — technical reference

Source-of-truth document for the implementation. Captures every detail
that was extracted from the J.O.E. Android APK (`ch.toptronic.joe`
v4.6.10) and validated against a real coffee machine (Jura S8 EB,
firmware `TT237W V06.11`, hostname `espressif.lan`, MAC prefix
`0c:8b:95` = Espressif Inc.).

Numbers, byte values and command codes here are *observed* values, not
guesses — if a behaviour differs from this doc, fix the doc.

---

## 1. Transport

| Layer | Port  | Protocol | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Discovery — broadcast  | 51515 | UDP | 16-byte scan probe, dongle replies via broadcast on same port |
| Discovery — unicast    | 51515 | UDP | Probe targeted at one IP; **TT237W ignores unicast** (broadcast-only) |
| Status / commands      | 51515 | TCP | Single long-lived session; one client at a time |

Both UDP and TCP services share the same port. On the TT237W firmware the
dongle does **not** reply to UDP scans at all — the client falls back to
a TCP-port-51515 sweep across the local /24s to locate machines.

### 1.1 TCP frame

Each frame is exactly:

```
b'*'   <encoded_body>   b'\r\n'
```

* `b'*'` (0x2A) is the sync byte that begins every frame.
* `<encoded_body>` starts with the *key byte* used to encode the rest of
  the body, followed by the obfuscated payload (see §2).
* `b'\r\n'` (0x0D 0x0A) terminates the frame.

A `recv` parser should:

1. Drop everything in the buffer up to (but not including) the next `*`.
2. Read until the next un-escaped `\r\n`.
3. Decrypt with the recovered key.

**Inner CRLF (verified against the J.O.E. Android app on TT237W).**
The *cleartext* body — the ASCII command string before the cipher runs
— also ends with a literal `\r\n`. So the bytes the dongle decodes
look like e.g. `@TM:13,211E96\r\n`, not `@TM:13,211E96`. This inner
CRLF is in addition to the outer frame terminator above. Discovered
the hard way: TT237W (Jura S8 EB) silently rejects settings writes
whose body has no inner CRLF, replying `@tm:00` for any
`@TM:<arg>,<val><csum>`. Reads happen to work without it, which made
the asymmetry hard to spot. `jura_connect.protocol.wrap` always
appends the inner CRLF on send (idempotent) and
`jura_connect.protocol.unwrap` / `FrameReader.next_frame` strip it on
receive so callers see clean payloads. Empirically every J.O.E.
phone→dongle and dongle→phone frame in the pcap carries the inner
CRLF, so this appears to be a general protocol rule, not a TT237W
quirk.

### 1.2 Reserved byte set

Five byte values trigger the escape mechanism inside the encoded body:

```
RESERVED = { 0x00, 0x0A, 0x0D, 0x1B, 0x26 }
```

Any byte that would otherwise sit in `<encoded_body>` and equals one of
these values is emitted as the two-byte sequence `0x1B <byte^0x80>`.
This also applies to the leading key byte itself. On receive, the
escape is undone before the cipher is run.

Note: the leading sync `0x2A` (`*`) is **not** in the reserved set —
once the decoder has past the sync byte it never expects another `*`.

---

## 2. Obfuscation cipher (`WifiCryptoUtil`)

A self-inverse, per-nibble permutation. The exact same routine encrypts
and decrypts; client and simulator both call into
`jura_connect.crypto.encode_payload` and `decode_payload`.

### 2.1 S-boxes

```
SBOX_A = (1, 0, 3, 2, 15, 14, 8, 10, 6, 13, 7, 12, 11, 9, 5, 4)
SBOX_B = (9, 12, 6, 11, 10, 15, 2, 14, 13, 0, 4, 3, 1, 8, 7, 5)
```

### 2.2 Key

For every outgoing frame the client picks a random key byte. Keys
whose low nibble is `0x0E` or `0x0F` are rejected (the J.O.E. app loops
until it gets a valid one); presumably those values would collide with
something else in firmware.

### 2.3 Per-nibble permutation

```
def _a(nibble, pos, key_hi, key_full):
    iB = (nibble + pos + key_hi) % 16
    i11 = pos >> 4
    inner = ((i11 + SBOX_A[iB] + key_full) - pos - key_hi) % 16
    outer = ((SBOX_B[inner] + key_hi + pos - key_full) - i11) % 16
    return (SBOX_A[outer] - pos - key_hi) % 16
```

`pos` is a running nibble counter (starts at 0, increments by 1 per
nibble — i.e. by 2 per byte). For a 100-byte payload `pos` reaches 200.

The function is its own inverse. Verified exhaustively in
`tests/test_crypto.py` for every valid key value plus 500 random
inputs.

### 2.4 Frame composition

```
write '*'
maybe-escape key, then write it
for each input byte b:
    eh = _a((b >> 4) & 0xF, pos,   key_hi, key_full)
    el = _a(b & 0xF,        pos+1, key_hi, key_full)
    enc = (eh << 4) | el
    maybe-escape enc
    pos += 2
write '\r\n'
```

Decoding reverses only the escape handling; the inner `_a` call is the
same.

## 3. Discovery

### 3.1 Scan probe

```
0x00 0x10 0xA5 0xF3   0x00 * 12
```

A static 16-byte UDP datagram, sent to the broadcast address of every
local /24. The reply (when one comes — only seen on older firmware than
TT237W) carries the structure below.

### 3.2 Reply layout

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| 0..2   |  2 | total length (big-endian) |
| 2..4   |  2 | control word: low 12 bits == 1523 (0x5F3); bit-15 set, bit-14 clear (per the APK's odd MSB-from-byte-0 numbering) |
| 4..20  | 16 | firmware version string, ASCII, space-padded (e.g. `TT237W V06.11`) |
| 20..52 | 32 | user-assigned machine name (e.g. `Kaffeebert`) |
| 52..68 | 16 | hardware identifier |
| 68..70 |  2 | article number (BE u16) |
| 70..72 |  2 | machine number (BE u16) |
| 72..74 |  2 | serial number (BE u16) |
| 74..76 |  2 | production date (`((year-1990)<<9) \| (month<<5) \| day`) |
| 76..78 |  2 | UCHI production date (same encoding) |
| 78..108| 30 | reserved / opaque |
| 108..109| 1 | extra byte |
| 109   |   1 | status flags: bit 0 = in-use, bit 4 = ready, bit 7 = standby |
| 110.. |  L | live alert bitfield (re-emitted as `@TF:<hex>` over TCP) |

### 3.3 Unusual bit indexing

The APK's `WifiFrog.G(idx, bArr)` function picks bit `(8*N - idx - 1) %
8` of byte `(8*N - idx - 1) // 8` for an N-byte array. For the 2-byte
control word this means `G(14)` reads bit 1 of the **high** byte (not
bit 14 of the word). Our parser mirrors this exactly; the unit test
`test_discovery.py::test_flag_helpers` covers it.

---

## 4. Handshake (`@HP:`)

### 4.1 Request

```
@HP:<pin>,<conn_id_hex>,<auth_hash>\r\n
```

* `pin` — ASCII PIN if the machine has one set; **empty** when none.
* `conn_id_hex` — `ExtensionsKt.c(SecurityManager.f40668d)` in the
  APK, which is just `''.join(f'{ord(c):02X}' for c in conn_id)`. The
  conn-id is *our* identifier (the J.O.E. app uses the device's
  Bluetooth name). It can be any ASCII string we choose.
* `auth_hash` — 64-hex-char token issued by the dongle on the **first
  successful pair**, or empty for an initial pair.

### 4.2 Responses

| Reply         | `ConnectionSetupState` | Meaning |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| `@hp4`        | CORRECT                | already paired, no fresh hash |
| `@hp4:<hash>` | CORRECT                | first-time pair: persist `<hash>` |
| `@hp5` / `@hp5:00` | WRONG_PIN         | PIN field wrong or required |
| `@hp5:01`     | WRONG_HASH             | conn-id unknown or hash stale |
| `@hp5:02`     | ABORTED                | conn-id known but hash mismatched / refused |

### 4.3 Unset-PIN pairing flow (verified against Kaffeebert)

1. **Client → dongle**: open TCP, send `@HP:,<conn_id_hex>,`
   (both pin and auth_hash empty).
2. **Dongle**: pops up a "Connect" dialog on its own touchscreen.
3. **User**: presses OK on the coffee machine.
4. **Dongle → client**: `@hp4:<64-hex-char-hash>`.
5. **Client**: persists `<hash>` (see §6) and treats the connection
   as authenticated.

On subsequent connections the client sends `@HP:,<conn_id_hex>,<hash>`
and gets back a bare `@hp4` (no on-machine confirmation needed).

The dialog timeout observed in practice is well under 60 s. The J.O.E.
app uses 40 s as its server-side timeout
(`WifiCommand.timeoutAfterSeconds = 40L`); the Python client uses
60 s by default for human comfort.

### 4.4 Failure modes seen in practice

* `@hp5:02 ABORTED` when reconnecting with an empty hash on a conn-id
  that was previously paired — the dongle remembers the slot and won't
  let it be silently re-claimed. **Solution**: pick a fresh `conn_id`
  and run the pair flow again (which trips the on-machine prompt).
* `@hp5:01 WRONG_HASH` when supplying a wrong hash for a known
  conn-id — same recovery: fresh `conn_id` + new pair.
* Empty hash with a *brand-new* conn-id that the dongle has never
  seen, but the dongle's display is asleep / not engaged: the dongle
  silently emits `@TF:` status frames without ever sending
  `@hp4`/`@hp5`. The Python client treats this as a `PairingTimeout`.

## 5. Commands

### 5.1 Read-only commands (implemented)

| Send             | Reply prefix      | Decoded type | Notes |

### 5.2 Unsolicited frames (received)

| Prefix     | Meaning |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `@TF:<hex>` | full machine status snapshot — alert bits, same layout as the discovery tail |
| `@TV:<hex>` | brewing-in-progress / product progress |
| `@hu:<code>` | heartbeat acknowledgement: `ok` / `wait` / `busy` / `abort` / `error` |

### 5.3 Maintenance counter layout (`@TG:43`)

12 bytes after the `@tg:43` prefix, 6 × big-endian u16. Order matches
the `<BANK Command="@TG:43">` section of the machine XML
(`assets/documents/xml/EF536/1.0.xml`):

```
[0..2]  cleaning
[2..4]  filter_change
[4..6]  descale
[6..8]  cappu_rinse
[8..10] coffee_rinse
[10..12] cappu_clean
```

Live example from Kaffeebert:
```
@tg:4300150001000801580E21005B
       └┘└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘
       21  1  8 344 3617 91
```

### 5.4 Status bits (`@TF:`)

Bits are addressed **MSB-first within each byte**, indexed globally
across the frame. The APK's `Status.a()` is the canonical decoder:

```java
return ((1 << (7 - (i % 8))) & bArr[i / 8]) != 0;
```

So bit *N* lives at byte ``N // 8`` with mask ``1 << (7 - (N % 8))``.
This catches everyone who reads the XML and assumes naïve byte-LSB
indexing — prior to v0.9.0 this codebase had the bug and mis-named
every status bit by 7 positions per byte. The `<ALERT Bit="N" …>`
attribute in the machine XML uses the SAME N that the APK decoder
expects; only the byte/bit extraction matters.

The client decodes the well-known S8 alert set (cf.
`jura_connect.client._STATUS_BITS`) and groups each bit by the
*severity* lifted from the XML's `ALERT.Type` attribute:

| XML `Type` | Python severity | Meaning |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `block`    | `error`         | the machine is genuinely stuck and needs user action (insert tray, fill water, …) |
| `info` or none | `info`      | informational state or low-supply reminder (`no_beans` with `Blocked="C"`, `heating_up`, `coffee_ready`, …) — not an error, just a flag |
| `ip`       | `process`       | a "schedule maintenance" prompt (descale / cleaning / filter / cappu rinse alerts) shown *before* it actually blocks brewing |

Live frame from Kaffeebert at idle: `@TF:0004000008000000`. Byte 1 =
`0x04` → MSB-position 5 set → global bit 13 = `coffee_ready`
(severity `info`). Byte 4 = `0x08` → MSB-position 4 set → global bit
36 = `energy_safe` (severity `info`). The machine is idle in
energy-save mode and the previous coffee is ready — neither bit is
an error, which matches reality.

The `MachineStatus` dataclass exposes `errors`, `info`, and
`process` as separate tuples plus the unsplit `active_alerts` for
backwards compatibility; only the first should drive "is the machine
broken?" logic.

### 5.5 Product brew counters (`@TR:32,<page>`)

The product counter table is paginated. The client issues 16
requests (`@TR:32,00` through `@TR:32,0F`); each reply has the form

```
@tr:32,<page_hex>,<8 hex bytes>
```

The 8-byte payload is four big-endian `u16` slot values. With 16
pages × 4 slots per page that gives a 64-slot table indexed by
product code:

* **Slot 0** carries the total number of brews ever performed on the
  machine.
* **Slots 1..63** carry the count for the product whose code matches
  the slot index, with `0xFFFF` reserved for "this code is not
  configured on this machine".

The product-code → human-name mapping comes from a `MachineProfile`
loaded by EF code (see §6 below). `jura_connect.client.PRODUCT_NAMES`
is the union map over the TT237W family (S8, ENA8, Z8, …) and is the
fallback when no profile is available. Profile-specific names take
precedence (`from_slots(slots, profile=…)`), so the S8 EB's `0x2B`
brews as `cortado` while the same code on the EF536 baseline is left
under `by_code`. Unknown codes always survive into
`ProductCounters.by_code` so a future firmware variant still surfaces
the raw count rather than dropping it on the floor.

Live first page from Kaffeebert (idle, after a few thousand brews):

```
@tr:32,00,0C9DFFFF004E0253
        └──┘└──┘└──┘└──┘
        3229 ----  78  595
        total       espresso  coffee
```

The second u16 (`FFFF`) is slot 1 = `ristretto` — not configured on
this S8 EB.

### 5.6 Programmable-recipe slots (`@TM:50` + `@TM:42,<slot>`)

The dongle's "PMode" interface exposes a small table of user-editable
recipe slots. Reading it is a two-step exchange:

```
client → @TM:50
dongle → @tm:50,<hex bytes ending in a checksum>
```

The body has one byte per recipe **kind** (the number of which is
machine-specific — the J.O.E. APK's PModeRequester does not encode it,
it asks the machine), followed by a single checksum byte equal to the
sum of those kind-bytes. The Python client sums the body modulo 256
and rejects the reply when the checksum doesn't match. The total
number of slots is `sum(per_kind_counts)`.

```
client → @TM:42,<slot_dec>
dongle → @tm:42,<slot_dec>,<product_code_hex>...   (slot is configured)
dongle → @tm:C2                                    (slot not exposed on this machine)
```

The S8 EB / EF1091 reports 20 slots via `@TM:50` (`@tm:50,0404040404` +
checksum `7A`) but answers every `@TM:42,<n>` with `@tm:C2`. That is
the "machine reports a PMode table but doesn't make any of it
addressable" branch — the EF1091 XML omits the `<PROGRAMMODE>` section
entirely. `ProgramModeSlots.supported_by_machine` flips to `False` in
that case, and the CLI prints ``not supported by machine``.

The real machine also resets the TCP connection on some slot indices
mid-table; the client catches `(ConnectionError, OSError)` and marks
the remaining slots as unsupported rather than blowing up the whole
``pmode`` command.

### 5.7 Machine settings (`@TM:<arg>` read / write)

Every machine XML carries a ``<MACHINESETTINGS>`` block. Each
``SWITCH`` / ``COMBOBOX`` / ``SLIDER`` element has a ``P_Argument``
attribute (e.g. ``"02"`` for hardness on EF1091); reading the setting
is

```
client → @TM:<P_Argument>
dongle → @tm:<P_Argument>,<value_hex>
```

Writing is the same address with a value and a trailing checksum
byte, **wrapped in @TS:01 / @TS:00**:

```
client → @TS:01                              (lock keypad)
dongle → @ts
client → @TM:<P_Argument>,<value_hex><csum>  (the write)
dongle → @tm:<P_Argument>                    (success — echo of the address)
dongle → @an:error                           (rejected — checksum or value bad)
client → @TS:00                              (release keypad)
dongle → @ts
```

The wrapping is non-optional on TT237W firmware: omit it and the
dongle still ACKs the bare ``@TM:`` write with ``@tm:<arg>``
(looking like success) but the machine silently ignores the new
value until the next power cycle. The J.O.E. APK enforces this by
dispatching every ``CommandPriority.PMODE`` command — which is the
default for ``WifiCommandWritePMode`` — through a
``PriorityChannel`` branch that prepends ``@TS:01`` and appends
``@TS:00``. The Python port now mirrors that wrap in
:meth:`jura_connect.client.JuraClient.write_setting`; releases
0.9.0 - 0.9.1 omitted it, which is why settings appeared to write
successfully but never took effect.

In addition, **the cleartext body must end with `\r\n` before the
cipher runs** (see §1.1). TT237W's failure mode for a missing inner
CRLF is the opposite of the missing lock/unlock wrapper: instead of
ACKing with ``@tm:<arg>``, the dongle ACKs with ``@tm:00`` (the
rejection token) and the value never changes. Releases 0.9.0-0.9.2
hit this on every write. Discovered by pcap-decoding the J.O.E.
Android app's AutoOFF write on Kaffeebert (``192.168.111.192``);
every J.O.E. body carries the trailing CRLF inside the cipher body.

#### ItemSlider value storage (AutoOFF on EF1091)

``ItemSlider`` settings like AutoOFF (``P_Argument="13"``) use a
1-byte *type-tag* prefix on the wire:

* ``21<vv>`` — 1-byte unsigned value ``vv`` follows
  (``211E`` = 30 dec = 30min, ``213C`` = 60 dec = 1h)
* ``22<vvvv>`` — 2-byte unsigned value ``vvvv`` follows
  (``220168`` = 360 dec = 6h, ``22021C`` = 540 dec = 9h)
* ``0F`` — a one-byte literal value with no tag (15min)

The dongle persists only the value bytes for the ``21`` form (so
writing ``211E`` and then reading ``@TM:13`` gives back ``1E``) but
returns the literal value including the ``22`` tag for the
two-byte form (writing ``220168`` reads back ``220168``).
:meth:`jura_connect.client.JuraClient.write_setting` accepts both
shapes when verifying the readback, and the CLI's
``setting auto_off`` lookup falls back to suffix-matching the
ItemSlider catalogue so ``1E`` resolves to ``30min``.

The checksum is two upper-case hex chars computed by the J.O.E. APK's
``ByteOperations.d``: sum the codepoint of every char in
``"<P_Argument>,<value_hex>"``, format ``(-1 - sum) & 0xFF``. The
Python port is in
``jura_connect.client._settings_checksum``.

Each EF code's ``<MACHINESETTINGS>`` block enumerates the user-tunable
settings. On EF1091 (S8 EB) the seven settings are:

| Name | Kind | Arg | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | --- | ----- |
| Hardness | StepSlider | `02` | 1..30°dH, step 1, mask `FF` |
| AutoOFF | ItemSlider | `13` | 15min..9h, 11 named ITEMs (1-byte + 3-byte values mixed) |
| Units | Switch | `08` | `00`=mL / `01`=oz |
| Language | Combobox | `09` | 11 languages, `01`=German .. `0B`=Estonian |
| DisplayBrightnessSetting | Combobox | `0A` | 10..100% in 10% steps, `01`..`0A` |
| MilkRinsing | Combobox | `04` | `00`=Automatic / `01`=Manual |
| Frother Instructions | Switch | `62` | `01`=On / `00`=Off |

``jura_connect.profile.SettingDef`` carries the parsed catalogue;
``SettingDef.normalise_value`` validates user-supplied input (range
+ step for sliders, item name OR raw hex for switches/comboboxes)
before the write is sent. The CLI's ``setting`` command goes through
both validation and the destructive gate.

### 5.8 **Destructive** commands — gated behind `--allow-destructive-commands`

These were observed in the EF536 machine XML or the APK and are
exposed as named registry commands but gated behind
`--allow-destructive-commands` (or `allow_destructive=True` for
library callers). The simulator returns `@an:error` for them as a
test-suite guardrail; running them via `raw '@TG:24'` is gated by
the same prefix check.

| Command | Effect |
| ------- | ------ |
| `@TG:21` | start `CappuClean` |
| `@TG:23` | start `CappuRinse` |
| `@TG:24` | start `Cleaning` |
| `@TG:25` | start descaling (`descale` command) |
| `@TG:26` | start `FilterChange` |
| `@TG:7E` | reset maintenance counters |
| `@TG:FF` | reset (something) |
| `@TF:02` | restart machine |
| `@AN:02` | power off |
| `@TP:<recipe blob>` | start brewing a product — see §5.9 |
| `@HW:01,<pin>` | set machine PIN |
| `@HW:80,<ssid>` | set WiFi SSID |
| `@HW:81,<pwd>` | set WiFi password |
| `@HW:82,<name>` | set dongle name |

Use these only via raw `JuraClient.request()` and only with explicit
intent — running `@TG:24` will start a real cleaning cycle.

### 5.9 Product start (`@TP:`) — the recipe blob (verified live)

Verified by **physically brewing** on a **JURA S8 EB / EF1091**
(owner's machine "kaffeebert", 2026-07) and, independently, on an
**E6** (upstream PR author's machine). Brewing works, but **not** with
a bare product code and **not** with the FF-padded blob earlier
versions of this library sent — both are ACKed and then silently
ignored. What the machine executes is a **16-byte recipe blob whose
unused bytes are `0x00` and whose byte 8 is a constant `0x01`**:

* **Padding is `0x00`, and byte 8 is always `0x01`.** An FF-padded
  blob (`@TP:28FF0709FFFF01FFFF09FF…`) is ACKed `@tp:00` and does
  **nothing** — no `@TB`/`@TV` frames, counter unchanged, tried both
  single- and double-send. The 00-padded, byte-8=01 form brews on the
  first send. Byte 8 is a fixed structural byte: no bundled product
  carries a parameter there (nothing uses `Argument="F9"`).
* **Byte positions come from the machine XML.** Every PRODUCT element
  lists its parameters with an `Argument="F<n>"` attribute
  (COFFEE_STRENGTH at F3, WATER_AMOUNT at F4, MILK_FOAM_AMOUNT at F6,
  TEMPERATURE at F7, BYPASS at F10, MILK_BREAK at F11). The F-numbers
  are the byte offsets of the *Bluetooth* start-product command, which
  carries a leading key byte; the WiFi blob does not, so **blob offset
  = F − 1**.
* **Water and bypass are sent in 5 ml ticks** (`ml / 5`, one byte).
  XML `Value`/`Min`/`Max` attributes are in ml. Milk foam and milk
  break are seconds, sent as-is; strength is the level number;
  temperature is the ITEM value (00/01/02).
* **Live-verified:** water, temperature, strength and bypass, from the
  three cross-model vectors (S8 EB `cafe_barista`, E6 `espresso`, E6
  `coffee`). **Not individually live-verified — may misbrew, verify on
  your hardware:** `milk_foam_amount` / `milk_break` (seconds, as-is).
* **`0x00` means "parameter not set"** — for parameters the product
  doesn't have. A water byte the product *does* have must still be set
  explicitly: with 00-padding an unset water byte is `0x00` = **no
  water** (a dry/short shot), so `build_recipe_hex` refuses to leave it
  unset rather than guess.
* Cross-model verified vectors (all 00-padded, byte 8 = 01):
  `@TP:28000709000001000109000000000000` (S8 EB cafe_barista),
  `@TP:02000809000002000100000000000000` (E6 default espresso),
  `@TP:0300021A000001000100000000000000` (E6 coffee, strength 2,
  130 ml, normal).
* No trailing checksum is needed (unlike `@TM:` writes), and no
  `@TS:01`/`@TS:00` lock wrapper is required.
* Reply behaviour: the dongle ACKs an **accepted** blob with a bare
  `@tp`, then emits `@TB` when the brew starts, `@TV:41<code>…`
  progress frames (byte 4 = current tick, byte 5 = target ticks,
  second-to-last byte = percent 0x00–0x64), and `@TV:3E<code>` on
  completion. A **rejected/ignored** blob gets `@tp:00` and no further
  frames — `@tp:00` is *not* an accept.
* A machine in `energy_safe` wakes on the first `@TP:` but may ignore
  that first command; a retry then brews. `JuraClient.brew(retry=True)`
  opts into resending the blob once if the first reply is not an accept
  (bare `@tp`). With the correct 00-pad/byte-8=01 layout it brews on
  the first send, so the retry is usually moot.

The named `brew` command builds this blob from the machine profile —
`brew hotwater water=220 temp=high` — validating every value against
the XML catalogue (range, step, allowed items) before it goes on the
wire. `JuraClient.brew()` / `ProductDef.build_recipe_hex()` are the
library entry points; a full hex blob is still accepted verbatim as
an escape hatch for firmware variants with a different layout.

The `products` command lists every brewable product on the connected
machine with its resolvable name and each `param=value` key's allowed
values (ranges/steps for water & milk, item choices for strength &
temperature) — built from the same profile, with no extra machine
I/O. Use it to discover exactly what `brew` accepts.

## 6. Machine variants (`MachineProfile`)

The 88 machine XML files extracted from the J.O.E. APK
(`assets/documents/xml/<EF_code>/<version>.xml`) are vendored under
`jura_connect/data/xml/` and loaded on demand by
`jura_connect.profile.load_profile(code)`. They provide:

* the **alert bitmap** — bit index → name → severity
  (`block`/`info`/`ip` in the XML, mapped to `error`/`info`/`process`
  in Python);
* the **product code → name** map for the brew-counter table;
* (where present) the `<PROGRAMMODE>` section, currently exposed only
  as the kind-count vector consumed by `@TM:50`.

### 6.1 EF code lookup

`jura_connect/data/JOE_MACHINES.TXT` (vendored verbatim from the APK)
is a `;`-separated table of
``<article_number>;<friendly_name>;<EF_code>;<type>`` rows. Example
rows around the S8 EB:

```
15480;S8 (EB);EF1091;tt237w
15533;S8 (EB);EF1151;tt237w
```

The CLI's pair flow reads the article number from a UDP discovery
reply (offset 68..70, BE u16) and looks the EF code up in this table.
On firmwares that don't answer unicast UDP (notably TT237W) the
lookup fails — pass `--machine-type EF1091` explicitly, or retro-fit
later with ``jura-connect set-machine-type --name … EF1091``.

`jura_connect.profile.iter_profiles()` parses every bundled XML once
and caches the result via `lru_cache`. Loading a single profile is
roughly an `ElementTree.parse` + a couple of `findall(".//{*}TAG")`
sweeps — wildcard namespace traversal is used because each XML
declares the same `xmlns="http://www.top-tronic.com"` default
namespace.

### 6.2 EF536 fallback

Credentials without a `machine_type` field fall through to the
synthetic ``EF536`` baseline (the only profile the codebase hard-coded
before v0.8.0). The fallback covers the alert names and the
common product codes for the S8 / ENA8 / Z8 lineage; it doesn't know
about the S8 EB's `cortado` (`0x2B`) and friends. That's why
EF1091-paired machines should explicitly carry `machine_type = EF1091`
in their credential.

---

## 7. Credential persistence

### 7.1 File location

Default: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/jura-connect/credentials.json`
(fall-back `~/.local/share/jura-connect/credentials.json`).

Override with the global CLI flag `--store /path/to.json` or the
`CredentialStore(path=...)` constructor argument.

### 7.2 On-disk format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "machines": {
    "Kaffeebert": {
      "address": "192.168.1.42",
      "conn_id": "jura-connect-7f31a8c2",
      "auth_hash": "13908FE4D3EB986B2465ACDB50398D4C1622836A5A1632257FF065C13156C052",
      "machine_type": "EF1091",
      "paired_at": "2026-05-11T08:42:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

`machine_type` is optional — omitted entries silently fall through to
the EF536 baseline. `CredentialStore.set_machine_type(name, code)`
retro-fits the field onto an existing entry without forcing a re-pair.

Writes go through a `mkstemp(dir=…)` + `os.replace` rename, so
mid-write power loss leaves the previous file intact. The file is
`chmod 0600`'d on write since the hash grants full control over the
machine.

### 7.3 End-to-end workflow

## 8. Code map

| Module                       | Responsibility |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| `jura_connect/crypto.py`        | per-nibble permutation, escape handling |
| `jura_connect/protocol.py`      | frame writer/reader on top of `crypto` |
| `jura_connect/discovery.py`     | UDP scan probe, broadcast-reply parser, TCP fallback sweep |
| `jura_connect/profile.py`       | per-machine `MachineProfile` registry built from the 88 bundled XMLs + `JOE_MACHINES.TXT` |
| `jura_connect/data/`            | vendored XMLs + `JOE_MACHINES.TXT`; shipped as `package-data` so installed wheels load profiles via `importlib.resources` |
| `jura_connect/client.py`        | `JuraClient` + structured read results + handshake state machine; profile-aware status / brew / pmode parsers |
| `jura_connect/commands.py`      | named-command registry (`info` / `counters` / `brews` / `pmode` / `mem-read` / …) used by CLI and library |
| `jura_connect/credentials.py`   | XDG-located JSON persistence (atomic write, 0600); `machine_type` field |
| `jura_connect/simulator.py`     | TCP server speaking the *same* protocol; used by tests |
| `jura_connect/__main__.py`      | CLI (`discover` / `probe` / `pair` / `command` / `creds` / `machine-types` / `set-machine-type`) |
| `tests/`                     | pytest suite — driven through the simulator end-to-end |
| `flake.nix`                  | dev shell + package + checks (passthrough pytest) |

Both the client and the simulator depend on the same two modules
(`crypto`, `protocol`) for framing, so a regression on either side
breaks both halves of the test-suite simultaneously.

## 9. Known unknowns / next steps

* `@HU?` returned `@hu:800` in some probes but `@TF:<hex>` in others —
  the dongle may have multiple response code paths for the same input
  depending on internal state. Currently the client just waits for the
  next `@TF:` and treats that as the status answer.
* Locked-screen behaviour: `@TS:01` followed by `@TS:00` works
  cleanly, but issuing `@TS:01` and then disconnecting leaves the
  display locked until power cycle.
* `@TM:42` returning data on a machine that *does* expose programmable
  slots has not been observed live — the S8 EB / EF1091 reports a
  slot count via `@TM:50` but answers `@tm:C2` for every index. A
  TT237W variant with a populated `<PROGRAMMODE>` XML section is
  needed to validate the configured-slot decode path.
